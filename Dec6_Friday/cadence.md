# Hardware Verification and the Formal Revolution
- Rafael Gontijo Hamdan - Sr.Software Engineering Manager, Verification Group, Cadence Brazil

## Summary
- Cadence overview
    - Computational Software
    - Culture of Innovation
- Formal Verification as a product: Jasper Basic

## Industry Chip Design Challenge: Verification and Software
- Behavioral Verification

### Why Formal
- the Pentium FDIV bug in 1994: **US$ 475 million**

## Hardware Behavioral Verification - Flow Overview
- Implement the FSM to count from

## Challenges: Convergence Problem
- Improve SAT solvers
- Hire formal experts to verify hardware
- Automate & deploy to show formal verification value

### Jasper UNReachability App
- Simulation tools that exclude dead parts of code, from coverage statistics

### Jasper Coverage App
- During SAT solver execution, we apply **proof-based abstractions**
- What if we get "spurious" counterexamples? Can we extract information from them?

## Final Remarks
- Formal has become mainstream in the Hardware development cycle
- Formal is tool, not the final goal. Embrace informality
- The industry needs the Academy
