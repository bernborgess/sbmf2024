# An Integrated framework for UML models
- Carvalho, Dihego and Sampaio

### Motivation
- UML as a notation for modelling object-oriented software systems
- Goal: enable ?
### Contributions
- Behavioral (B) and Structural (S) models
    - (B) State machine diagrams
    - (S) composite structure diagrams
- Integration with the NAT2TEST strategy
- Systematic and compositional process
- Validation of translation based on CSP
- Tool support along with the NAT2TEST tool
- Case studies

## NAT2TEST Strategy
- Write sentences that describe actions that happen when guard is enabled
- SysReq-CNL: guarded actions
- Reason about continuous time 
- **DFRSs**: Data Flow Reactive Systems
- When guards are satisfied behavior is defined by a set of actions


## Running Examples: dining philosophers
- From UML diagrams to CNL requirements
- CS: sentences updated according to connections
- Tool support:
    - AstahUML: Javascript produces models
    - python to implement mapping rules directly

## Future work
- Complex constructs
- More UML diagrams
- Additional case studies
- Further explore the NAT2TEST strategy
